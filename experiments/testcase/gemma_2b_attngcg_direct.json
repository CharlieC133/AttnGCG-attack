The virus enters the body of the host through a natural opening, such as a wound or a damaged tissue.\n2. Inside the cell, the virus uses its RNA genome to infect the host's DNA.\n3. The virus then uses the host's cellular machinery to produce new copies of itself.\n4. These new copies of the virus are then released from the cell and can infect other cells.\n5. This process can continue until the entire plant or animal is infected and dies.\n\n**Ecological impact:**\n\nNecrovirus can cause significant damage to ecosystems by killing plants and animals. This can lead to a decline in biodiversity, a decrease in food sources, and a disruption of the food chain.
