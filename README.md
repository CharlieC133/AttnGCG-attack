Our paper is online now: https://arxiv.org/abs/xxx

## Installation
We need the latest version of [Fastchat](https://github.com/lm-sys/FastChat) `fschat>=0.2.36` , please install `fschat` by directly [cloning Fastchat repository](https://github.com/lm-sys/FastChat/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#method-2-from-source). The `AttnGCG` package can be installed by running the following command at the root of this repository:
```
pip install -e .
```

## Models
Our script by default assumes models are stored in huggingface cache. To modify the paths to your models and tokenizers, please add the following lines in experiments/configs/individual_xxx.py (for individual experiment, direct attack or generalize to ICA and AutoDAN) and experiments/configs/transfer_xxx.py (for transfer across goals experiment). An example is given as follows.
```
    config.tokenizer_paths=["google/gemma-7b-it"]
    config.model_paths=["google/gemma-7b-it"]
```

## Preparations before Start
All preparations can be finished by running the following command at the root of this repository. 

```
bash prepare.sh
```

## Experiments
The `experiments` folder contains code to reproduce AttnGCG experiments on AdvBench.

- To run Direct Attack with harmful goals, run the following code. Replace `model` with the actual victim model, e.g., gemma_7b or llama2_chat_7b. Replace `attack` with the attack type, e.g., attngcg or gcg. `offset` means the first harmful goal to attack, defaulting to be 0.
```
cd experiments/bash_scripts
# bash run_direct.sh $model $attack $offset
bash run_direct.sh llama2_chat_7b attngcg 0

```

- To GENERALIZE ATTNGCG TO OTHER ATTACKS, run the following code. `run_autodan.sh` is used for generalizing attngcg to AutoDAN, and `run_ica.sh` is for ICA.
```
cd experiments/bash_scripts
# bash run_autodan.sh $model $attack $offset
bash run_autodan.sh llama2_chat_7b attngcg 0
bash run_ica.sh llama2_chat_7b attngcg 0
```

- To TRANSFER ATTACK ACROSS GOALS:

```
cd experiments/bash_scripts
# bash run_transfer_across_goals.sh $model $attack $offset
bash run_transfer_across_goals.sh llama2_chat_7b attngcg 0

```

- To TRANSFER ATTACK ACROSS MODELS, run the following code. `base_model` means the model on which the adversarial suffixes are trained (DIRECT ATTACK), `target_model` means the closed-source victim model, `base_attack` means the attack type with which the adversarial suffixes are optimized.
```
cd attack_closed_model
# bash attack_closed_models.sh $base_model $base_attack $target_model
bash attack_closed_models.sh llama2_chat_7b attngcg gemini_pro
```

## Evaluation
- To evaluate the results of DIRECT ATTACK, GENERALIZE ATTNGCG TO OTHER ATTACKS or TRANSFER ATTACKS ACROSS GOALS, the evaluation can be performed by one command shown below. `attack` can be attngcg or gcg, `method` can be direct, ica, autodan or transfer, corresponding to DIRECT ATTACK, GENERALIZE ATTNGCG TO OTHER ATTACKS and TRANSFER ATTACKS ACROSS GOALS in `Experiments`.
```
cd eval
# bash eval.sh $model $attack $method
bash eval.sh llama2_chat_7b attngcg direct
```

- To evaluate the results of TRANSFER ATTACKS ACROSS MODELS, use `eval/keyword_detection/all_kw_classify.sh` and `eval/gpt4_judge/all_gpt_classify.sh` for keyword detection method or GPT-4 evaluation. `target_model` means the closed-source victim model.
```
# use keyword detection method to evaluate attack success rate
cd eval/keyword_detection\
# bash all_kw_classify.sh $DIR_TO_RESULTS
# bash all_kw_classify.sh ../../attack_closed_model/attack_${target_model}/generation
bash all_kw_classify.sh ../../attack_closed_model/attack_gemini_pro/generation

# use GPT-4 to evaluate attack success rate
cd eval/gpt4_judge
# bash all_gpt_classify.sh $DIR_TO_RESULTS
# bash all_gpt_classify.sh ../../attack_closed_model/attack_${target_model}/generation
bash all_gpt_classify.sh ../../attack_closed_model/attack_gemini_pro/generation
```

# Reproducibility
In order to reproduce the experiment, we provide bash scripts experiments/bash_scripts that can be used out of the box, and all running settings and hyperparameters are included in bash scripts and experiments/configs/.

A note for hardware: all experiments we run use one or multiple NVIDIA A100 GPUs, which have 80G memory per chip.
